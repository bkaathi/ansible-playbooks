Release	     : EMCGrab v4.2

Release Date : April 15, 2009

Author	     : GSTools

*****************************************************************************************

PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION NOTICE:
On some hosts, where high I/O is a normal course of events,
running the EMCGrab utility may cause some performance
degradation when running some commands. 

Best practices should prevail, such as running at off peak hours

*****************************************************************************************

IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR ALL OS:

If the EMCgrab is run with the -autoexec feature enabled and the host uses naviseccli 
(in case of navicli is not found) then in order to collect Clariion information, the 
security file should have been already created using -AddUserSecurity feature of naviseccli.
If that file is absent then EMCGrab will not collect any clariion information. 

If a Symmetrix is attached to a host and if the symmetrix devices are not enabled for 
masking then, while running the symmaskdb and symaccess commands you can encounter 
a message as: 

"No device masking database records could be found for the specified input parameters"

IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR SOLARIS:

****** Before running EMCgrab please take note of these ETAs ******

ETA emc108113: PowerPath 4.4 / 4.3.1: SYMCLI commands hang or fail.
HBA goes Offline/Online. This issue is resolved in SAN release 4.4.9
for Solaris 8 & 9. For Solaris 10, fix included in 119130-17.
 
ETA emc121607: Solutions Enabler: Solaris Leadville MPxIO segments 
Solution Enabler communication through multi-path gatekeepers or
other data devices.

Solaris 5.9: If patch 114476 is installed, if at revision 04 or less,
may cause a panic when running hbainfo commands. Install patch
114476-05 or greater to prevent the panic. Ref: emc118999

ETA emc206187: Solutions Enabler: The "symmask list -hba" command hangs and 
EMCGrab hangs or can take hours to complete on Solaris 10.
This issue has been taken care in this grab  release by replacing above 
command with the command "syminq hba"

IMPORTANT NOTICES for AIX:

****** Before running EMCgrab please take note of these ETAs ******

ETA emc111737: AIX 5.3 ML2 host crashes when pass-through I/O 
is performed. APAR IY70336 or AIX 5.3 ML3 resolves this issue.

ETA emc110417: AIX lspath may report a path as enabled when it
has actually been removed. This may cause a system failure.
APAR IY70336 or AIX 5.3 ML3 resolves this issue.

ETA emc178626: EMC ControlCenter: Recent IBM patches to AIX may result 
in system crash when using ControlCenter, Solutions Enabler or inq.

           be run without username, password and scope	


****************************************************************************************

This script is provided as a means to collect system and/or software 
configuration for investigations by EMC.

To Install :

Extract the tar file into a suitable directory using following command, 

command: tar -xvf emcgrab_<os>_<version>.tar  

Please ensure that your filesystem has at least 500M free of disk space 
for temporary files that may be generated during its processing.  
If running ECC 5.x the resulting tar file could be very large.

Please NOTE:

1. The script will prompt the user with a warning message
should it detect less than 25M remaining on the file system every time the
script runs the file system check routine. Each time the user will have the
option of continuing or aborting the script.

2. The script will prompt for EMC license agreement even in autoexec
mode. Once EMC license agreement is accepted then it will work as usual for
autoexec mode.

Operation :
The script should be run as user root, to prevent any data not being 
collected through lack of permissions.

The scripts defines a PATH environment based on the default installation paths
of it's software.  If these are different, some modules may not work.

It is possible that some commands could run for a lengthy period. Each module
has a max runtime limit, ranging from 60 seconds through to 450, depending
on the module.

The script will generate a compressed tar file, residing in the outputs
directory.  Its format will be 
'<hostname>_YYYY-mm-dd-hh.mm.ss>_<OS>_emcgrab_<version>_[full | lite]_CC<Request Number>.tar.<Z|gz>'
depending on whether compress or gzip has been used as their compression utility.

If no Request number is defined, <CaseNo> will default to 0000000000

Syntax :

./emcgrab.sh [-h] [-v] [-lite] [-backup] [-autoexec] [-symmid bypass|prompt] [-o options,options] 
	     [-clariionIP <IP Addresses> ] [-OUTDir new_output_directory] 

where
	-h	    : Displays help screen
	-v	    : Displays version information
	-o	    : User defined options, Comma Separated List (See below)
	-lite	    : A reduced subset of data collection as required
		    : by EMC's automated analysis server
	-symmid     : bypass|prompt - Bypasses Symmetrix or prompts for each Symmetrix detected
	-backup	    : Bypasses interactive menu, when scheduled via cron.
	-quiet	    : Suppress all status messages
	-clariionIP : Comma separated list of IP addresses for SPA / SPB
	-ip         : Comma separated list of IP addresses for SPA / SPB
        -OutDir     : Option to store final EMCGrab file at specified location
        -vxdmpdebug : Runs vxdmpdebug script with 'Y' option enabled
        -autoexec   : Bypasses user interactive prompts (but will prompt for EMC's license)

Options :

This is a comma separated list of additional modules. By default these
options are not run, and need to be invoked by the -o syntax.

to the Symmetrix. The script will attempt to check for the existance 
of a gatekeeper, and it this check fails, you will have the option to 
abort the remainder of this module. Some commands may not return any output,
depending on whether the relevant Solutions Enabler license has been installed.
